            Why AI-Generated Text Needs Humanization
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-7">
            It's crucial to realize that AI-generated text contains vocabulary and grammar patterns that can be recognized by AI detectors easily. Just using AI content from platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Microsoft Copilot, and submitting it as your work can pose challenges when it comes to authenticity.

            Benefits of Converting AI to Human Text
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-7">
            There are various benefits to converting AI to human text. If we write the article ourselves, it may lack some readability, and some words and sentences may look like AI-generated content. After converting AI text to human, the content is enriched with high-quality words, and the readability of the article improves.

            Limitations of AI-Generated Content Over the Internet
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-7">
            AI-generated content is hard to rank on Google or any other search engines, and it's very important to rank in search engines. AI-generated text often misses the subtleties of context and human emotions, which can make it feel robotic or distant.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-7">
            AI struggles to grasp the nuances of language, which can lead to errors in understanding or inaccuracies. Maintaining a consistent tone and style across the text can be challenging, resulting in inconsistencies in communication and brand portrayal.
